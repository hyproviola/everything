# Everything
> Everything about tech, programming, etc.

I will be adding things here as I come across them or remember them.

My goal is to cover as much as possible, from turning a wire
on and off, to making your toaster Rick roll you when it's finished,
to building websites and world wide networks.

Use your browsers search function (usually CTRL+F) to
find something you're looking for in the list below.

If you'd like to suggest something for me to cover, add it to
the `./TODO.md` file. Please don't add information, just
topics. The goal is for *me* to learn as I go so that I understand
everything thoroughly. If you want this to be a resource for everyone
where many people contribute please fork it and make it so.
